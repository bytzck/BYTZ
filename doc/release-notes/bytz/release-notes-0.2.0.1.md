Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

### Backup your data folder

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then backup your
wallet and private keys. 


### Install and run the new client

Start the new client: run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over
/Applications/Bytz-Qt (on Mac) or bytzd/bytz-qt (on Linux) and run it.

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.2.0.0

Downgrading to a version older than 0.2.0.0 is not supported due to
changes in the database format.

Notable changes
===============

This release features minor bug fixes, adds a menu option to unlock the wallet for staking, and enables a more
smooth connection to the network.
